              <p>On behalf of New World of Work and our training host {{ hostSite }}, we are delighted to have you participate in the 21st Century Employability Skills Training next week at {{ location }}. The two-day training provides an overview of all 20 lesson modules, video content, data collection templates, 21st Century Digital Badges, and offers tips on facilitation strategies. The training is fast paced, interactive, and allows participants time to practice through group teach-backs. Participants can earn a non-credit certificate of completion at the end of Day 2. Attached is the training two-day agenda for more information as well as a campus map and parking permit.</p>
